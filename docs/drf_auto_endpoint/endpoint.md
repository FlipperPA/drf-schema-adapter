# The `Endpoint` class

As with Django's `ModelAdmin` class you can also define your own `Endpoint` class and register it
with the router instead of registering a model.
In simple terms, `Endpoint`'s are a wrapper around a DRF ViewSet and Serializer.

```
# my_app/endpoints.py
from drf_auto_endpoint.endpoints import Endpoint
from .models import MyModel

class MyModelEndpoint(Endpoint):

    model = MyModel
    read_only = True
    fields = ('id', 'name', 'category')
```

```
# urls.py
from drf_auto_endpoint.router import router
from my_app.endpoints import MyModelEndpoint

router.register(endpoint=MyModelEndpoint())

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^api/', include(router.urls)),
]
```

## Attributes

### `model`

The `Model` class the endpoint should represent

### `fields`

*defaults to all fields from the model*

A tuple or list of field that should be present. This is the same attribute as what you would give
to a `ModelSerializer`'s Meta class.

### `include_str`

*default:* `True`

Boolean indicated whether or not `__str__` should be included in the automatically-generated list of fields.

### `read_only`

*default:* `False`

Boolean indicating whether this `Endpoint` should be a read-only `Endpoint` or not.

### `permission_classes`

*default*: `None`

A list or tuple of permission classes to apply to th Endpoint.
Similar to the `permission_classes` attribute you would use on a
[DRF `ViewSet`](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#setting-the-permission-policy)

### `base_serializer`

*default*: `ModelSerializer` (from `settings.DRF_AUTO_BASE_SERIALIZER`)

`Endpoint`'s will automatically generate serializers based on `ModelSerialier`.
You can override this behavior and pass in your own `base_serializer` tha will be used to generate
the serializer associated with the `Endpoint`.

### `serializer`

*default:* `None`

Instead of letting the `Endpoint` automatically generate a serializer you can pass in a serializer class
of your own using the `serializer` attribute


### `base_viewset`

*default:* `ReadOnlyModelViewSet` *(if* `read_only = True` *) or* `ModelViewSet`
(from `settings.DRF_AUTO_BASE_VIEWSET` and `settings.DRF_AUTO_BASE_READONLY_VIEWSET`)

`Endpoint`'s will automatically generate viewsets based on `ModelViewSet` or `ReadOnlyModelViewSet`.
You can override this behavior and pass in your own `base_viewset` tha will be used to generate
the viewset associated with the `Endpoint`.

### `viewset`

*default:* `None`

Instead of letting the `Endpoint` automatically generate a viewset you can pass in a viewset class
of your own using the `viewset` attribute.

### `filter_fields`

*default:* `None`

A list or tuple containing a list of fields the `Endpoint` should be able to filter on.
Similar to the `filter_fields` attribute you would pass to a Viewset using a
[`DjangoFilterBackend`](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#djangofilterbackend)

### `search_fields`

*default:* `None`

A list or tuple containing a list of textual fields the `Endpoint` should be able to search on.
Similar to the `search_fields` attribute you would pass to a Viewset using a
[`SearchFilter` backend](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter)

### `ordering_fields`

*default:* `None`

A list or tuple containing a list of fields the `Endpoint` should be able to sort on.
Similar to the `oredering_fields` attribute you would pass to a Viewset using an
[`OrderingFilter` backend](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#orderingfilter)

### `page_size`

*default:* `None`

An integer representing the number of records that should be present per result page.
Similiar to the `page_size` attribute you wouls pass to a viewset using
[`PageNumberPagination`](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/pagination/#pagenumberpagination)

### `fieldsets` :warning: Only used by [metadata](./metadata.md)

*defaults to a single fieldset without title containing the same fields as the `fields` attribute*

A list or tuple containing the list of fieldsets to use. A fieldset has 2 properties,
a `title` and a list of `fields`. Somewhat similar to the
[`fieldsets` attribute of a `ModelAdmin` class](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets)
while more powerfull as you are free to describe any number of levels of nested records here.

### `save_twice`

*default:* `False`

Used to indicated to the frontend that this model should be saved twice (once before and once after related models) for new records or after having saved the related models for existing records.
This is useful for models that have a oneToMany
relationship to a model (let's call it employees) and a foreignKey to that same model (let's call it favourite).

### `sortable_by`

*default:* `None`

The name of the field by which models in this endpoint can be re-ordered (usually `position`).
